<h1>Keyword Planning FAQ for US Website Teams</h1>

<section aria-labelledby="faq-intro-heading">
<h2 id="faq-intro-heading">Frequently asked questions about keyword research and content planning</h2>
<p>This FAQ addresses common questions that arise when implementing keyword research and content planning processes for US-focused websites. Whether you are new to search optimization or refining existing practices, these answers provide practical guidance grounded in established standards and proven methodologies. Each question reflects real challenges that content teams encounter when building and maintaining search-optimized websites.</p>
<p>The answers here emphasize approaches that work for static websites without relying on JavaScript-based tracking or dynamic content generation. This constraint actually simplifies many aspects of SEO while requiring more thoughtful upfront planning. By understanding these fundamentals, you can build websites that perform well in search results while remaining accessible, fast, and easy to maintain.</p>

<h2 id="questions-heading">Common questions and detailed answers</h2>
<details>
<summary>How do I choose keywords that match US search intent?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Choosing keywords that match US search intent requires understanding the three primary intent types and how American users express their needs through search queries. Informational intent describes searches where users seek knowledge or answers to questions. Navigational intent describes searches where users want to find a specific website or page. Transactional intent describes searches where users want to complete an action, whether purchasing a product, signing up for a service, or downloading a resource.</p>
<p>US English presents specific considerations that differ from other English-speaking markets. Spelling conventions (color versus colour, optimize versus optimise) affect which keyword variations to target. Regional terminology varies across the country, with different terms used for the same concepts in different states or regions. Cultural context influences how Americans frame questions and what assumptions they bring to searches.</p>
<p>To validate your keyword choices, review the actual search engine results pages for your target terms. Examine what types of content currently rank: are they how-to guides, product pages, comparison articles, or something else? This reveals what search engines have determined satisfies user intent for those queries. Once your site is live and verified in Google Search Console, you can analyze actual query data to see which searches bring users to your pages and refine your targeting based on real performance data.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How many keywords should one page target?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Each page should target one primary keyword theme plus closely related secondary terms that naturally fit within the same content. This approach differs from older SEO practices that attempted to optimize individual pages for single exact-match keywords. Modern search engines understand semantic relationships and topical relevance, rewarding comprehensive content that thoroughly addresses a subject rather than pages narrowly focused on specific phrases.</p>
<p>Avoid keyword stuffing, which means artificially inserting keywords at unnatural frequencies or in contexts where they do not belong. A natural keyword density typically falls between one and two percent, but this should never be a target you write toward. Instead, write naturally for your audience and ensure your primary topic is clear from headings, introductory paragraphs, and overall content structure.</p>
<p>The related secondary terms often appear naturally when you write comprehensively about a topic. If your primary theme is keyword research for US websites, secondary terms like search intent, content planning, and SERP analysis will likely appear because they are inherently related to the subject. This natural inclusion signals topical depth to search engines without requiring artificial optimization.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is keyword cannibalization and how do I prevent it?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Keyword cannibalization occurs when multiple pages on your website compete for the same search queries, diluting your ranking potential and confusing search engines about which page to show for relevant searches. Instead of one strong page ranking well, you end up with multiple weaker pages that may rank poorly or fluctuate unpredictably in search results.</p>
<p>Prevention starts with creating and maintaining a page map that explicitly assigns keyword themes to specific pages. Before creating new content, check your map to determine whether an existing page already covers that topic. If so, consider updating the existing page rather than creating a new one. This consolidation approach builds stronger, more comprehensive resources rather than fragmenting your content across multiple thin pages.</p>
<p>When you discover existing cannibalization, you have several remediation options. You can consolidate overlapping pages into a single comprehensive resource, redirecting the retired URLs to the consolidated page. You can differentiate pages by refining their focus to target distinct aspects of a broader topic. You can also use canonical tags to indicate which page should be treated as the primary version when similar content must exist at multiple URLs for legitimate reasons.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do I structure headings for SEO and accessibility?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Proper heading structure serves both search engine optimization and accessibility by creating a clear document outline that machines and humans can navigate effectively. Each page should have exactly one h1 element that describes the page's primary topic. This h1 typically matches or closely relates to the page's title tag and serves as the main heading users see when they arrive on the page.</p>
<p>Subsequent headings should follow a logical hierarchy using h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections within those sections, and so on. Never skip heading levels, as this creates confusion for screen reader users who navigate by heading structure. An h3 should only appear after an h2, and an h4 should only appear after an h3.</p>
<p>Headings should describe the content that follows them, not serve as decorative elements or keyword insertion points. A heading like "Understanding search intent for US audiences" tells users and search engines what the section covers. A heading that simply repeats a keyword phrase without context provides less value and may appear manipulative to search engines.</p>
<p>This structure benefits accessibility because screen reader users can navigate directly to sections using heading lists. It benefits SEO because search engines use heading structure to understand content organization and identify key topics covered on the page.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do I need schema on a static site?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Yes, schema markup provides valuable structured data that helps search engines understand your content, and it works perfectly well on static websites. JSON-LD format is particularly well-suited for static sites because it exists as a self-contained block that does not require server-side processing or JavaScript execution to function.</p>
<p>For FAQ pages like this one, FAQPage schema markup can enable rich results in search that display questions and answers directly in search listings. This increased visibility can improve click-through rates and help users find answers faster. The markup simply describes the questions and answers that already exist on the page in a format search engines can parse reliably.</p>
<p>Other schema types relevant to static sites include Organization schema for your homepage, Article schema for blog posts or guides, and AboutPage schema for your about page. Each type helps search engines categorize your content and may enable enhanced search result displays.</p>
<p>The constraint with schema is that you should only mark up content that actually appears on the page. Schema should describe visible content, not add information that users cannot see. This alignment between markup and visible content maintains trust with both search engines and users.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do I measure success without JavaScript?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Measuring website performance without JavaScript-based analytics requires relying on server-side data sources and external tools that do not depend on client-side tracking scripts. This approach actually provides more accurate data in some respects, as it is not affected by ad blockers or browser privacy features that prevent JavaScript analytics from loading.</p>
<p>Server logs record every request made to your website, including page views, referring URLs, user agents, and response codes. Analyzing these logs provides accurate traffic data and can reveal patterns in how users navigate your site. Many hosting providers offer log analysis tools, or you can use dedicated log analysis software.</p>
<p>Google Search Console provides essential data about how your site appears in search results, including impressions (how often your pages appeared in search), clicks (how often users clicked through to your site), average position (where your pages ranked), and the specific queries that triggered your listings. This data comes directly from Google and does not require any tracking code on your site.</p>
<p>Third-party rank tracking tools can monitor your positions for target keywords over time, helping you understand whether your optimization efforts are improving visibility. For conversion tracking, you may need to track conversions at the destination rather than on your static site, such as monitoring form submissions on a separate system or tracking purchases in an e-commerce platform.</p>
